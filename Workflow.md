# General workflow of the project - step to be implemented:

1. Set up the email factory to be able to create POP, SMTP and IMAP connections to a server. Should be able to connect
to different servers - gmail, yahoo, etc.
2. Basic functionality will include retrieving email content from a server - sender, topic, date, maybe message and the
ability to clean 'INBOX' folder, while simultaneously making a record of what's been cleaned, perhaps in a database.
3. Additional functionality can include - having notification for cleaned emails from specific senders, pulling out emails
from specific senders from the database, automatic replies to certain emails, etc.
